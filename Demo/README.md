A complete pipeline demo. It supports processing and analysing a subset dataset example from scratch.

---

Before running the pipeline, you must download the required dataset. An example for one patient can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HyPIAKVM44XB4ef_h-1_CQiGHmveWTID)
Once downloaded, place the data in the same directory as the notebook. (*add here the size of the sample-dataset)
